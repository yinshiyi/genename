# Genename

This is a R script to annoate a gene ID list, aka find the full description of each gene ID.
eg. TP53 in the input file will be assigned with "The TP53 gene provides instructions for making a protein called tumor protein p53 (or p53). This protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it regulates cell division by keeping cells from growing and dividing (proliferating) too fast or in an uncontrolled way."
